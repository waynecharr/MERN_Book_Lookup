# Contributing

- Worked with two tutors this week Faran Navaza and Sangeetha Kaliaperu. Additionally, I worked my instructor Nicole Thomas to get the project to deploy. 
- Referred to the MERN in class assignment modules for most of the graphQL related work

# Instructions

In order to run the assignment you will need to install the necessary json packages. 

- navigate to the client folder than run ```npm install```
- navigate to the server folder than run ```npm install```
- navigate to the highest folder than run ```npm install```

Once all the packages are install locally, you should be able to run the program at using ```npm run develop```

# Deployment 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get a live to deployment to run via render. I was repeatedly running into the same issue there.
